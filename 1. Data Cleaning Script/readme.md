This folder [1. Data Cleaning Script] contains R code/script that will clean both datasets found in the "0. Raw Data" folder and save the cleaned data to the "2. Clean Data" folder. 

If you have not visited the "0. Raw Data", please navigate to the folder and review the accompanying readme and .qmd file for further insight into how the data was collected and provided to me for this analysis.

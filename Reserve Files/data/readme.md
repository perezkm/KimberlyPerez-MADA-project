This folder contains all data, both raw, found under the raw_data folder, and processed, found under the processed_data folder. Explore each to get a better grasp of the data collected. I then encourage you to navigate back to the "code" folder where you will find all coding stages (e.g., processing and analysis-pending) with detailed instructions of the coding process.
